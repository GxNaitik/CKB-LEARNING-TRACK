## What I Learned

- Got introduced to the Nervos Blockchain and CKB.
- Learned how Nervos uses a multi-layer setup:
  - L1 Security and decentralization.
  - L2 Making transactions faster and scalable.
- Learned about CKBytes (CKB) — Nervos’ native token for storage and transaction fees.
- Explored NC-MAX, Nervos’ enhanced Proof of Work for secure and efficient consensus.
## Resources I Used

- [How CKB Works](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/how-ckb-works)
- [Quick Start with offCKB](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/quick-start)
- [offCKB SDK and developer tools](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/offckb)
- Completed the [Basic Theory course on CKB Academy](https://academy.ckb.dev/courses/basic-theory)

## Key Takeaways

- Nervos is designed to be super secure and decentralized while still being modular.
- The multi-layer approach solves a lot of blockchain limitations by splitting responsibilities.
- Cells are the basic unit that store data and assets immutably.
- The CKB virtual machine (CKB-VM) lets developers run smart contracts efficiently.
- NC-MAX consensus boosts throughput without sacrificing security.
- offCKB makes it easier to get a local development environment up and running quickly.
