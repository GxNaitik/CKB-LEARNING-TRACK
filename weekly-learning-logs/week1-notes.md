# Week 01: Nervos Blockchain Fundamentals

**Date:** 16th Oct â€“ 23rd Oct, 2025

## What I Learned

- Got introduced to the Nervos Blockchain and the Common Knowledge Base (CKB), which acts as the core trust layer.
- Learned how Nervos uses a multi-layer setup to balance things like security, scalability, and decentralization:
  - Layer 1 takes care of security and decentralization.
  - Layer 2 focuses on making transactions faster and scalable.
- Found out about CKBytes, the Nervos native token, which basically represents data storage space and also pays for transaction fees.
- Started exploring programming on Nervos with languages like Rust, JavaScript, and C using the CKB-VM environment.
- Understood how Nervos uses an improved Proof of Work consensus called NC-MAX to keep the network secure and efficient.

## Resources I Used

- [How CKB Works](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/how-ckb-works)
- [Quick Start with offCKB](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/quick-start)
- [offCKB SDK and developer tools](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/offckb)
- Completed the [Basic Theory course on CKB Academy](https://academy.ckb.dev/courses/basic-theory)

## Key Takeaways

- Nervos is designed to be super secure and decentralized while still being modular.
- The multi-layer approach solves a lot of blockchain limitations by splitting responsibilities.
- Cells are the basic unit that store data and assets immutably.
- The CKB virtual machine (CKB-VM) lets developers run smart contracts efficiently.
- NC-MAX consensus boosts throughput without sacrificing security.
- offCKB makes it easier to get a local development environment up and running quickly.
